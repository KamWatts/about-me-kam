  <h1 class="welcome-text">Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>

  <h2 class="welcome-text">Here's a look into my life as a Software Engineer</h2>
  
  <p class="aboutme-text">
    My name is Kameron Watts. I am 28 years old living in Seattle, WA. I grew up in Cleveland, OH and I am a huge Ohio State Buckeye fan. Some of my hobbies include cinematic photography, weightlifting, and travelling to new places. I started coding when I was 24 years old while in the military when a friend referred me to coursera.com and I have not looked back since then. Coding started to become a daily habit for me in summer of 2022 while I simultaneously started preparing to exit my job at the time. During this process, I started applying to Code Fellows. I was originally looking to fund my education through my GI Bill until I found out about VETTEC - a program to fund tech education for veterans. I took advantage of the opportunity and chose to commit to pursuing a career in software engineering.

  <p class="aboutme-text">
    <ul>
    <li>I have extensive experience in customer service and public safety. Starting when I was a junior in highschool, I took advantage of a post-secondary education program, EXCEL TECC, in Mayfield, OH that exposed me to the world of emergency services, firefighting, and law enforcement. Throughout high school I worked in retail spanning from Hollister, to a locl grocery store, to being a host at Applebee's the Neighborhood Grill!</li>

    <li>Very promptly after graduating high school I shipped out for the U.S. Army to South Carolina where I would undergo training. I enlisted as a Forward Observer - a job that requires a lot of math, attention-to-detail, and very methodical planning schemes to meet the goals and needs of demanding requirements to provide protection and security during convoys and team manuevers through various types of environments. Parts of the skillset to become a forward observer is to be proficient at land navigation, and finding accuarate grid coordinates with multi-million dollar laser-precision equipment. I had the opportunity to collaborate with different teams on various missions. Eventhough I was in the U.S. Army, I worked very closely with the Air Force and Marine Corp. on joint task missions.</li>

    <li>I served over 3 years in active duty before serving 3 years in the Washington National Guard while also working as a State Trooper with the Washington State Patrol. My experience on patrol has opened my eyes to many forms of communication and proper preparation for worst case scenarios. As a State Trooper you are expected to be skilled at reading moods and behaviors of those you come in contact with as well as being a curator of good questions, problem-solver, professional driver, and community organizer. I took on extra tasks such as volunteering for community events in the inner-city neighborhoods around the city of Tacoma, providing mentorship to kids in troubled homes. My career in law enforcement also granted me the opportunity to be a State Trooper in the unique State of Alaska. In Alaska I honed in on my investigation skills that brought closure to many victims of many heinous crimes.</li>

    <li>Communication has been the forefront skill needed to succeed at every job I have held since I graduated high school 10 years ago. I have adopted many soft skills from the aforementioned professions that will serve me well in the tech world. I am a problem-solver, communicator, and compassionate team mate. My goal is to bring a positive mindset and workk ethic to any development team I become a part of.</li>
