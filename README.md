## About Me Project

I constructed an app using HTML, CSS, and JS. Upon entering the page you will be presented with a set of questions, after the questions are answered, you enter the website.

I am implementing an interactive questionnaire that utilizes JavaScript to iterate through wrong and right answers as the user guesses questions about my interests.
